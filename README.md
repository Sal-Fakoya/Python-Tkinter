     ### 1. Projects Folder:
      Projects Folder contains folders on projects built using tkinter:
     1. Calculator App built
     2. Text-to-Audio App

         #### Calculator App: 
        The `Calculator_App` folder has a `Calculator_App_V2.py` script.
          - The `Calculator_App_V2.py` is a simple arithmetic calculator app made in Python using Tkinter library.
          - It collects and evaluates expressions using the buttons in the calculator.
          - Operations it can perform include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
          - It can also clear the calculator screen and show history. The history is a scrollable Listbox in x and y directions.
          - The calculator is expandable, meaning the widgets and text sizes on the buttons increase
              when the window size is increased or maximized as desired.

        #### Text-to-Audio App:
        Using the `main` branch, go to the `Projects Folder`. The python script to this app is the `Text_to_Audio_App`.
          - The Text-to-Audio app can convert a PDF file to audio
          - The audio will play when a file has been uploaded and the play button is pressed.
          - The audio will stop when the "stop playing" button is pressed or when the app is closed by the user.
